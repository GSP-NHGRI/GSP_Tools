# GSP_Tools

## The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) uses genome sequencing to identify genes and genomic variants underlying human inherited disease across its full spectrum, including rare diseases likely to be due to rare variants with strong effects (Mendelian), and common genetically complex diseases that are caused by many variants. Novel methods, tools, and knowledge gained through the GSP will be rapidly shared to enhance the ability of the community to pursue other human inherited diseases.

## This github respository serves as a collection of all tools developed by GSP Centers. The repository is organized by GSP components:
- Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG)
- Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), [http://github.com/CCDG](http://github.com/CCDG)
- GSP Analysis Centers (GSPAC)
- GSP Coordinating Center (GSPCC)
